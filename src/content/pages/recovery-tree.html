            <h2 class="qura-section-title">The Metaphor of the Tree</h2>
            
            <div class="qura-feature-description">
                <p>Recovery isn't a destination - it's a daily practice of self-care and commitment. The Recovery Tree is a gentle reminder of this truth.</p>
                
                <p>Each day you open the app and "water" your tree, it grows a little more. A tiny seedling becomes a sapling, then a young tree, and finally - after 30 days of consistent care - a strong, mature oak with deep roots.</p>
                
                <p>The tree doesn't judge you. If you forget to water it one day, it simply pauses. It doesn't wither or die. It waits patiently for you to return, ready to continue growing the moment you come back. This is how you should treat yourself - with patience, not punishment.</p>
                
                <p>The message is simple but profound: <strong>You deserve the same care and attention you give this tree.</strong> Recovery requires daily nurturing. Some days will be easier than others, but the key is consistency and self-compassion when you stumble.</p>
                
                <p>By the time your tree reaches full maturity, you'll have built a 30-day habit of daily check-ins. You'll have proven to yourself that you can commit to something, one day at a time. And just like a real tree, your recovery will have roots strong enough to weather any storm.</p>
