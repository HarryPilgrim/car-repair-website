                    <p class="qura-feature-tagline">Hi, I'm Harry. Like many of you reading this, I struggled with porn addiction for years. It cost me my mental health, relationships, and sense of self-worth. This is the app I wish I'd had during my darkest moments.</p>

            <h2 class="qura-section-title">My Journey to Recovery</h2>
            
            <div class="qura-feature-details-grid">
                <div class="qura-feature-description">
                    <h3>The Struggle</h3>
                    <p>It started innocently enough in my teens - curiosity, boredom, easy access. But by my early twenties, porn had become my default coping mechanism for stress, loneliness, and anxiety. Every time I felt uncomfortable, I'd escape into pixels on a screen.</p>
                    
                    <p>The consequences crept up slowly. I struggled with depression. My relationships suffered - intimacy became difficult, connection felt impossible. I isolated myself, convinced I was broken beyond repair. The shame was overwhelming, yet I couldn't stop.</p>
                    
                    <p>I tried everything: willpower alone (failed repeatedly), generic habit trackers (too impersonal), porn blockers (easily bypassed), even therapy (helpful but expensive and not always available when I needed it most). Nothing addressed the core issue - I needed tools for the hardest moments AND a framework for long-term recovery.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qura-feature-highlights">
                    <h3>Finding What Works</h3>
                    <p>My breakthrough came when I stopped relying on willpower and started using a system. I discovered that recovery required multiple tools working together:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="qura-feature-list">
                        <li><strong>Tracking:</strong> Measuring my progress made the invisible visible</li>
                        <li><strong>Breathing exercises:</strong> Calmed my nervous system during urges</li>
                        <li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Taught me to observe urges without acting</li>
                        <li><strong>Wisdom literature:</strong> Stoic philosophy gave me discipline</li>
                        <li><strong>Emergency interventions:</strong> Real strategies saved me countless times</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Most importantly, I learned to treat myself with compassion instead of punishment. Recovery isn't linear. There were setbacks, but each one taught me something.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <!-- Transformation -->
            <div class="qura-feature-description" style="margin-top: 3rem; text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                <h3>The Transformation</h3>
                <p>Today, I'm not the same person who started this journey. The depression lifted. My relationships deepened. I found genuine confidence and self-respect that no amount of success or achievement had given me before.</p>
                
                <p>But more than personal freedom, I gained a mission: to help others find the same path. Too many men are suffering in silence, convinced they're uniquely broken, trying to fight with inadequate tools. They deserve better.</p>

                <div class="qura-benefit-card">
                    <div class="qura-benefit-icon">🛠️</div>
                    <h3>All the Tools in One Place</h3>
                    <p>I had to cobble together solutions from multiple apps, books, and therapists. Qura combines everything that actually works into one cohesive system.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="qura-benefit-card">
                    <div class="qura-benefit-icon">🤖</div>
                    <h3>AI That Understands</h3>
                    <p>Aida isn't a generic chatbot - she's trained specifically for porn addiction recovery, with contextual memory of your journey. It's like having a therapist available 24/7.</p>

                <div class="qura-benefit-card">
                    <div class="qura-benefit-icon">🎯</div>
                    <h3>Built for Real Crises</h3>
                    <p>Most apps fail when you need them most. Qura's panic button provides immediate, multi-layered intervention designed for those crucial 10 minutes when urges are strongest.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Compassion, Not Shame</h3>
                    <p>Recovery apps often feel punitive. Qura is built on the principle that helped me most: treat yourself with the same patience and compassion you'd show a good friend.</p>
                </div>

                    You're not broken. You're not uniquely flawed. You're dealing with an addiction that hijacks one of the most powerful drives in human biology. That's not weakness - that's neuroscience. And with the right tools, you can absolutely break free.
