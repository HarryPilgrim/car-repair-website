    description: "<p>Meditation isn't about stopping thoughts or achieving some mystical state - it's about training your mind to observe urges and impulses without automatically reacting to them. This skill is crucial for porn addiction recovery.</p>
    
    <p>When you meditate regularly, you create space between urge and action. Instead of an urge leading immediately to relapse, you learn to notice the urge, acknowledge it, and let it pass. This is the foundation of impulse control.</p>
    
    <p>Qura's guided meditations are specifically designed for recovery. Body Scan meditation builds awareness of physical sensations and tension that often precede urges. Golden Light visualization helps process shame and cultivate self-compassion. Anxiety reduction meditations address the stress and discomfort that frequently trigger relapses.</p>
    
    <p>All sessions are fully guided with calming voice narration, background music, and adjustable lengths from 5 to 20 minutes. Perfect for beginners or experienced practitioners.</p>",

    seoTitle: "Why Meditation Works for Porn Addiction",
    seoText: "<p>Research shows that meditation is one of the most effective tools for addiction recovery. Studies on mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) demonstrate significant reductions in relapse rates compared to standard treatment alone.</p>
    
    <p>The mechanism is clear: meditation strengthens your brain's ability to notice cravings without automatically acting on them. It literally rewires neural pathways, making impulse control easier over time. For porn addiction specifically, this means you can observe an urge, acknowledge it, and choose not to act - rather than feeling powerless against it.</p>
    
    <p>Qura's meditation library is designed specifically for the challenges of porn addiction recovery. Body scan helps you recognize physical warning signs. Anxiety reduction addresses a major relapse trigger. Golden Light visualization helps heal the shame that keeps many people trapped in the cycle.</p>",

                    <h3>Breaking the Automatic Response</h3>
                    <p>Porn addiction creates an automatic stimulus-response loop: trigger → urge → action. Meditation teaches you to insert awareness between urge and action, breaking this automatic cycle.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Processing Difficult Emotions</h3>
                    <p>Many people turn to porn to escape uncomfortable feelings - boredom, loneliness, stress, shame. Meditation trains you to sit with these feelings without needing to escape, removing a major driver of relapses.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Building the Prefrontal Cortex</h3>
                    <p>Brain scans show meditation literally thickens the prefrontal cortex - your impulse control center. This isn't metaphorical; you're physically strengthening the part of your brain responsible for saying "no" to urges.</p>
